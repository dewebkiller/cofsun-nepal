                    <p>Nepal has been steeping up in various stages of REDD+ process and becoming one of the leading countries to follow REDD+ (Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Sustainable Management of Forests, and the Conservation and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks) process with support of World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).  National REDD+ Strategy, Nepal, 2018 has been considered community forest is one of the key interventions to address the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. The REDD Implementation Center (REDD IC) has been supported to revise  CFOPs under the World Bank supported REDD Readiness project for achieving objective of National REDD+ strategy.Community-Based Forestry Supporters’ Network, Nepal (COFSUN, Nepal), with the support of REDD IC, had  attempted 250 CFOPs to revision in cluster -1 districts (Bhojpur, Dhankuta, Terhathum and Sankhuwasabha) and 250 CFOPs in cluster -5 (Bardia, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dot and Darchula)as service provider.</p>
                    <p>The main objective of revising 500 Operational Plans of the CFUGs is reduce backlog number of OP in thes district in line with sustainable forest management principles with consultation of concern CFUGs and Division Forest Office (DFO) in both clusters (1 and 5). COFSUN has followed participatory approach, and trying to address GESI concepts in the context of restructured government. Similarly, COFSUN has been introduce CCA and DRR, climate change and REDD perspectives in newly revision OP.</p>

                    <p>The team is composed of Mr. Sudil Gopal Acharya (as team leader cum forestry expert), Ms. Astha Rijal (as GESI Expert) and 20 crew members to complete the assignment. The team leader has coordinated and facilitated the assignment while GESI expert facilitated in the incorporation of GESI issues in the OP revision of cluster 1. Similarly, cluster 5’s team was composed of Mr. BR Paudyal as team leader cum forestry expert, Ms Poonam Pant Bhatta as GESI expert and 26 crew members (4 female and 22 male).

</p>
                    <p>The Desk Review and Analysis, Orientation to crew members, Consultation meeting with Divisional Forest Office (DFOs), FECOFUN district Chapter in 9 districts before start the field work.  Consultation meeting with CFUGs is the entry action for OP revision adopted by COFSUN. By which COFSUN had able to complete Forest Survey and Inventory and Socio-Economic Survey of 251 CFs in cluster 1 and 249 CFs in cluster 5 in expected time schedule. At the end of the given time COFSUN has able to prepare 500 draft CFOPs and submitted to concern Divisional Forest Office in both clusters. The orientation has developed 21 skilled human resources for facilitating the community forest especially for the OP revision. The assignment has created approx. 4000 working days employment along with involvement of approx. 25000 CFUG members. Coordination between CFUGs and local government has been enhanced. COFSUN found that; need of CFUG has been changed (shifted); which is trying to address in the CFOP revision process. Similarly; COFSUN found that; the database of CFUG available in district and center were outdated, so we suggest that; that should be update in time for proper information.</p>

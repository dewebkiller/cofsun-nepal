                    <p>Sustainable forest management (SFM) practice has long history in Nepal. The understanding of SFM is also varied in different among the types of the forest based on the ownership; collaborative forest (CoF) and community forest (CF). In CF, SFM is the participatory approach-based management of forest balancing three pillars of sustainable forest management: environment, social and economic. In Nepal, 19,361 Community Forestry User Groups (CFUGs) are managing 1,813,478 hectares of National forest; more than 2,641,549 households have benefited (DoF, 2017). CFM is an approach of sustainable forest management in collaboration with the local people to achieve multiple benefits maintaining ecological balance, generating economic returns and improving livelihood from the government managed forests (CMWG, 2003). Both forest management have different modality and working approached but emphasis on local people’s participation for their benefits. COFSUN, Nepal only mobilizes the FFs in community forest.</p>

                    <p>The community forestry progress is steady and is one of the successful program in Nepal. Behind the success of the community forestry, many hands such as government and nongovernment organizations, activists, staffs, researcher, stakeholders, rightsholders and users are engaged. The communities themselves are the key for the success of CF. Besides these, forestry facilitators have also played vital role in the community forest facilitating forest users/ communities and government body. Forestry facilitators are involved in every step/process of the community forest with communities/users. They also played as a mediator between community and government/non-government bodies. They served the communities to achieve the benefit that provided the community forest. Therefore, forestry facilitators have great contribution in success of community forestry, sustainable forest management, resource utilization, building good governance, livelihood, restructuring in federalism, DRR and CCA.</p>

                        <p>CCommunity-based Forestry Supporters’ Network, Nepal (COFSUN, Nepal) is a network of the community based forestry facilitator, which was established in 2004 with the initiation of 251 facilitators from 51 districts. COFSUN, Nepal is an independent, non-governmental, non-political, non-communal and non-profitable organization that is committed to Right Based Approach (RBA). Its fundamental notion is to enhance community based forestry programmes by exchanging experience of facilitators and by developing their capacity for integrated resource management through Community Forestry User Groups (CFUGs). COFSUN, Nepal is indeed a common forum for facilitators from government and non-state sectors who work at local level to central level. More than 1360 members from 72 Districts (including government employee and non-state professionals) are affiliated to date with this network. Upon its ten years of journey in the community forestry movement, it has already established 34 District branches..</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a <strong>galley of type and </strong>scrambled it to book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
